        Question 1:
        Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Then return the number of unique elements in nums.

        Consider the number of unique elements of nums to be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

        Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the unique elements in the order they were present in nums initially. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
        Return k.

        Example 1:

        Input: nums = [1,1,2]
        Output: 2, nums = [1,2,_]
        Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
        It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
        Example 2:

        Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
        Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]
        Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
        It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
 

        Constraints:

        1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104

        nums is sorted in non-decreasing order.

        performance when checking for element existence, as HashSet has constant-time complexity for lookup operations. 
        The function focuses on determining the number of unique elements rather than directly modifying the original

        Question 3:
        Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets [nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]] such that i != j, i != k, and j != k, and nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0.

        Question:7
        Given an integer array nums, return the largest perimeter of a triangle with a non-zero area, formed from three of these lengths. If it is impossible to form any triangle of a non-zero area, return 0.

        Example 1:

        Input: nums = [2,1,2]
        Output: 5
        Explanation: You can form a triangle with three side lengths: 1, 2, and 2.
        Example 2:

        Input: nums = [1,2,1,10]
        Output: 0
        Explanation: 
        You cannot use the side lengths 1, 1, and 2 to form a triangle.
        You cannot use the side lengths 1, 1, and 10 to form a triangle.
        You cannot use the side lengths 1, 2, and 10 to form a triangle.
        As we cannot use any three side lengths to form a triangle of non-zero area, we return 0.

        3 <= nums.length <= 104
        1 <= nums[i] <= 106

        This problem finds the largest perimeter of a triangle that can be formed using three

        Question:8

        Given two strings s and part, perform the following operation on s until all occurrences of the substring part are removed:

        Find the leftmost occurrence of the substring part and remove it from s.
        Return s after removing all occurrences of part.

        A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.



        Example 1:

        Input: s = "daabcbaabcbc", part = "abc"
        Output: "dab"
        Explanation: The following operations are done:
        - s = "daabcbaabcbc", remove "abc" starting at index 2, so s = "dabaabcbc".
        - s = "dabaabcbc", remove "abc" starting at index 4, so s = "dababc".
        - s = "dababc", remove "abc" starting at index 3, so s = "dab".
        Now s has no occurrences of "abc".
        Example 2:

        Input: s = "axxxxyyyyb", part = "xy"
        Output: "ab"
        Explanation: The following operations are done:
        - s = "axxxxyyyyb", remove "xy" starting at index 4 so s = "axxxyyyb".
        - s = "axxxyyyb", remove "xy" starting at index 3 so s = "axxyyb".
        - s = "axxyyb", remove "xy" starting at index 2 so s = "axyb".
        - s = "axyb", remove "xy" starting at index 1 so s = "ab".
        Now s has no occurrences of "xy".

        Constraints:

        1 <= s.length <= 1000
        1 <= part.length <= 1000
        s and part consists of lowercase English letters.
